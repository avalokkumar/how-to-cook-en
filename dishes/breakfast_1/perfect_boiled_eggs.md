The circulating boiling method developed by scientists can achieve the effect of dense eggs, uniform protein solidification and retaining the most nutrients.The temperature and time need to be accurately controlled, which is more difficult.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★★

## Essential raw materials and tools

- Fresh chicken eggs (recommended AA grade)
- 100°C boiling water kettle (straight ≥15cm)
- 30°C Temperature water pellet (straight ≥15cm)
- Timer
- Slotted spoon

## calculate

Each serving:

- 1 chicken egg (approximately 60g)
- 100°C boiling water 1500ml
- 30°C Temperature 1500ml

## operate

- Prepare two tins of water: A tins maintain 100°C boiling water, B tins maintain 30°C warm water
- Use a colander to put the egg into the A-cup to start the timer
- **Precisely transfer the egg to another pot of water every 2 minutes**
- Repeated transfer operations total 16 times (total length 32 minutes)
- After the last transfer, 30 seconds on the B-steel static
- Put in ice water immediately and stop heating (maintaining for 30 seconds)
- Starting from the end air chamber at the shell, lying away the egg membrane along the axle

## Additional content

- Key parameters:
- Egg yellow center temperature: 67±1°C
- Protein layer temperature:
- External layer: 100°C → 87°C
- Medium level: 87°C → 55°C
- Inner layer: 55°C → 30°C
- Nutritional advantages: The content of polyphenols is 23% higher than that of traditional cooking methods
