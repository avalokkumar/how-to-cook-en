## Essential raw materials and tools

* Roche Shrimp
* butter
* Mustard
* White sugar
* Soup
* Oyster sauce
* Salt
* Cooking wine, rum or beer
* coriander
* garlic

## calculate

By serving 1 plate:

* Roche shrimps over 1 kilogram. The market price in Guangdong is about 40~45 per kilogram.
* Butter about 20g
* Mustard 15g
* White sugar 3g
* Soup soy sauce 30g
* Oyster sauce 30g
* 3g salt
* Cooking wine, rum or beer 15g to 30g
* 5 pieces of coriander cut into segments
* 5 garlic chopped into garlic

## operate

* Cut off the tips, tentacles and feet of Roche shrimp with head and tail, open the shrimp body and back with scissors to remove the shrimp thread.
* Stir the mustard sauce in advance: soy sauce, oyster sauce, mustard, salt, sugar, and stir evenly!
* Wash the coriander and cut it into sections and set aside.
* Drain the Roche shrimps, add oil to the pot, and directly add Roche shrimps, over medium heat, fry the surface until golden brown, and remove.
* Add garlic and over high heat, use the remaining oil of the fried shrimp to continue frying the garlic. Wait until white mist appears in the pot and the garlic has already tasted fragrant. Add shrimp and butter to allow the shrimp to fully absorb the butter aroma.
* Add the prepared sauce, continue to boil over high heat, stir-fry the shrimps until the sauce is juiced, and add the wine (30g of cooking wine and beer, and 15g of rum flavor is strong.)
* Wait until the sauce is slightly reduced, add coriander and stir-fry for two times, and then it is served.

## Additional content

* The sauce is prepared in advance and the butter is prepared in advance to prevent the intermediate preparation from taking time.
* Remember to wait until the shrimp is fried before taking it out before adding it to prevent it from becoming black and bitter when frying for too long.
* If you can't accept it, put it less mustard, and put it more if you can accept it. If you can put it too much, cook it for a while and the mustard taste will also dissipate.
