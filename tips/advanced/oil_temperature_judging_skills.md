# Oil Temperature Judgment Techniques and Common Temperature and Unit Conversion Table

* Oil temperature between 120&deg;C-140&deg;C: Suitable for soft frying[^1] and stir-frying[^2]. Place chopsticks into the oil pot, and there will be almost no bubbles, no smoke, no sound, and the oil temperature is calm.
* Oil temperature between 150&deg;C-160&deg;C: Optimal cooking temperature. Place chopsticks into the oil pot, and a few oil bubbles will appear around, with slight smoke, and the oil moves from the edges to the center.
* Oil temperature between 160&deg;C-180&deg;C: Suitable for coloring and crisp frying. Place chopsticks into the oil pot, a large amount of smoke rises, and the oil surface is relatively calm.
* (Note) It is best to buy an oil temperature gun and use a thermally cautiously.

> In online video tutorials, the so-called "n-level oil temperature" refers to a percentage of the full oil temperature, which is 300&deg;C.
> That is, n-level oil temperature T_n = 30n [degree Celsius]
> Temperature conversion formulas:
> C = 5/9 *(F - 32)
> or
> F = 9/5*C + 32

* ^1: Soft frying involves coating small pieces, slices, or strips of ingredients with batter, frying them in oil until they are 70-80% cooked.
* ^2: Stir-frying uses tender animal-based ingredients cut into strips, slices, cubes, or strips, coated with egg white and starch, quickly fried in warm oil, and drained of excess oil using a coordinate.
