## Essential raw materials and tools

* A bag of frozen dumplings that have not expired

## calculate

* Generally, one person can eat 7 to 10 dumplings
* A dumpling requires about twice the body's water (when pouring the dumplings into the pot, the height of the water should be one to two times the height of the dumplings, that is, the height of the dumplings is 1, and the height of the water is 1~2)

Using the above conditions, calculate the proportion of raw materials planned to be used.

## operate

* Over medium heat, pour the water into the pot and wait for the water to boil.
* Pour dumplings into the pot.
* You can use water before pouring into the pot.
* After pouring in the dumplings, you can stir the water with a stir-frying spoon or shovel, but be careful not to shovel on the dumplings to avoid tearing the skin on the pan or sticking to each other, causing the adhesions to grow.
* The frequency does not need to be too high, and the average `3` seconds is shaken every `30` seconds. You don’t need to do this step after the dumplings float.
* After the dumplings float and the water boils again, use a stir-frying spoon to hold a dumpling to observe. If the dough is covered with raw material, you can scoop 80ml of cold water in a stir-frying spoon, cool down the water, and then continue to boil until boiling. Repeat this observation and stirring operation, and add water up to twice to cook.
* After all dumplings float (about 8 minutes after the dumplings are placed), use a spatula or colander to shovel the dumplings into a plate or bowl, and then serve after serving.
* After eating the dumplings, wait until the water temperature in the pot drops, pour out the water and brush the pot in time with dishwashing detergent. Otherwise, the flour cooked in the pot will form a sticky substance on the wall of the pot after a while.
