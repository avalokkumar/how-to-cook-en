## Additional content

- Make sure the soup is warm when added when stewing
- Do not buckle the cover when stewing or the potatoes will rot
- Stew and turn it from time to time to avoid the bottom
- Stewed casserole is even better. You can stir-fry in the wok and pour it into the cooking pot. If you use the casserole to boil the pot, do not use high heat to avoid cracking
- Don't have too much soy sauce. The soup will become salty when concentrated. It's okay to lighten it when it is thin. When it is not enough when it is stewed, you can add soy sauce.
- Do not use chicken essence MSG, as it will snatch the freshness of beef
