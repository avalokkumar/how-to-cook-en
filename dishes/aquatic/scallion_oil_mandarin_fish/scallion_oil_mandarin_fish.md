## calculate

Here we take 2 copies as an example to arrange them.During actual operation, considering that the texture and umami flavor of the fish itself will change with the volume of a single fish, it is recommended that you try to choose 2 servings to operate the umami flavor when cooking.

- Mandarin fish = 1 catties (500g)
- Green onion = 1 (length is 30cm)
- Xiaomi spicy = 2 pieces
- Ginger = 50g
- Cooking wine = 25g
- Vegetable oil = 15g
- Salt = 8g
- Steamed fish soy sauce = 10g
- Qingshui = 5L

## operate

- Go to the vegetable market to buy fish that has been processed (it is best not to have internal organs if you deal with it yourself), and scrape all the scales on the surface of the fish body
- Use kitchen paper to wipe clean the bone-adhesive blood and black film in the fish belly (bone-adhesive blood will affect the taste, and black film is the source of the fishy smell)
- Use a kitchen knife to scrape the surface of the fish body several times, scrape off the mucus on the fish body, further remove the fishy smell, and then rinse the fish inside and outside with clean water
- Place the fish flat on the cutting board, use kitchen paper to dry the water inside and outside the fish, then the fish head is facing left and tail is facing right, starting from the edge of the fish gills, and cut it vertically every 3cm to reach the depth of the fish's spine. Use the same treatment method on the other side
- Place the fish flat in the basin to make sure there is no excess water in the dish
- Take a piece of 50g ginger (egg size), remove the skin on the surface with a paring knife, and wash it clean, and cut it into ginger slices with a thickness of 3mm
- Wash the millet spicy, remove the stems, and cut into small circles with a thickness of 2mm (or into filaments with a width of 1mm)
- Wash the shallots, remove the roots, and cut them into small 3cm segments. A slightly thicker shallot can be split in the middle along the direction of the shallots growing.
- Add 8g of salt, 25g of cooking wine to the pot, bring disposable gloves, and massage the fish for 1 minute to make sure that salt and cooking wine are evenly applied to each part of the fish body
- After massage the fish, put a slice of ginger into each knife edge of the fish body, put 3 slices of ginger into the fish belly, and marinate for 10 minutes (it is recommended not to marinate for too long, otherwise the freshness of the fish will decrease)
- During the fish marinating, add 5L of water to the steamer, and after boiling, place a steamer on the steamer
- After the fish is marinated, moisture will be precipitated. Pour out the excess water and marinated with cooking wine and ginger slices, rinse the fish body and belly with clean water, and dry the fish body and belly with kitchen paper.
- Place the fish flat in a steamed fish plate and put ginger slices on the edge of the fish body and belly
- Then put the steamed fish plate in the steamer, cover the lid, and steam it in medium heat for 20 minutes
- During this period, the steam will adhere to the entire fish and plate, and form fish soup after it is condensed. Do not pour out the soup after it is released. This soup is umami essence
- Use anti-scalding clip to clip out the steamed fish plate and drizzle 10g steamed fish soy sauce around the fish body and fish
- Then evenly sprinkle green onion and millet spicy on the fish body and around it
- Pour 15g of vegetable oil into an iron pot and simmer over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Do not use high heat, otherwise the oil will evaporate very quickly.
- Sprinkle the hot oil evenly and slowly on the fish, and the fresh scallion oil and mandarin fish with fresh eyebrows are out of the oven!

## Additional content

After several tests, the success rate is 100%. This dish is very fault-tolerant and can be compatible with people in any province or taste.In addition, although this set of tutorials is called the method of making scallion-oiled mandarin fish, the raw materials themselves are not limited to mandarin fish. It can be replaced by sea fish such as sea bass and tulip fish (freshwater fish itself has a little more parasites than sea fish, and it is not recommended to use freshwater fish. For freshwater fish, please refer to the tutorials such as "Braised Fish" for freshwater fish). It has low coupling and strong scalability.
