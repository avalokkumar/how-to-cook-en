# How to make chiffon cake

Chiffon Cake is an introductory baking dish that has a certain difficulty in operation.But after successful production, its taste is delicate and soft, which is evocative.With the baking time, it takes **1.5 - 2 hours* for ordinary beginners to complete it.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★★

## Essential raw materials and tools

### tool

* Oven (Rice cooker can be replaced, but in most cases, it is easy to fail due to the material problems of the pot gallbladder)
* Egg whisk (electric is the best, manual labor is laborious and has a certain probability of failure) or chopsticks (very not recommended)
* Aluminum alloy anode mold (never choose non-stick mold, commonly used sizes are 6 inches or 8 inches)
* Scraper (for stir-frying cake batter)

### Raw materials

- egg
- White sugar
- Milk (or water)
- Cooking oil (or butter, but heated and softened)
- Low-gluten flour (recommended)
- [Optional] Lemon juice or white vinegar

## calculate

Each serving (12 units of area):

- 1 egg (normal medium size, about 50g)
- White sugar 16g
- Edible oil 8g
- Milk 10g
- Low-gluten flour 17g

Specifically, for common 6-inch and 8-inch cakes:

* 6 inches: 3 servings in size (i.e. three eggs).Area 36 units.
* 3 eggs, 50g of sugar, 25g of cooking oil, 30g of milk, 50g of low-gluten flour
* 8 inches: 5 servings in size (i.e., five eggs).Area 64 units.
* 5 eggs, 80g of sugar, 40g of cooking oil, 50g of milk, 90g of low-gluten flour

## operate

### Preliminary separation operation

* Remove fresh eggs from the refrigerator
* Prepare two containers and wipe dry them, and place egg white and egg yolk respectively
* For the container that holds egg white, there may be a little water droplets, but there should not be any oil; the container that holds egg yolks should not contain water droplets
* Beat the eggs, manually or using the egg splitter, separate the egg whites and the yolks into two containers.
* The egg yolks cannot be broken during separation, and no egg yolks can be mixed in the egg white, otherwise it will seriously affect the beating.(The white lace can enter the egg white without affecting it)
* (Note that when the kitchen machine is not used, the container for egg whites is also a container for beating. To avoid overflow, do not exceed **1/8** of the container after adding all egg whites)

### Stir egg yolk liquid

* Prepare a new empty bowl, add all cooking oil, and stir in low-gluten flour
* Oil will directly block the formation of gluten
* Add the egg yolk to the bowl, then add the milk and **1/4** white sugar, stir evenly with a spatula
* Although the milk added at this time contains water, it should not form gluten.
* Prepare the low-gluten flour and use a spatula "Z-shaped stir" (zigzag stir) while slowly sprinkling it into the container, that is, the spatula can only move both sides or back and forth along the direction of the blade.**Don't stir in anti-clockwise or clockwise in disorder**
* Continue, add all the flour, and use the above stirring method until mixing evenly and without dry powder.(It is normal for some clumps to appear, so you can continue to stir and disperse it)
* Leave it on standby

### Puff away the egg whites

* Prepare the remaining **3/4** sugar.Divide into three portions, each portion is **1/4** of the total amount
* Add lemon juice or white vinegar to the egg white (optional)
* In medium speed of egg beater, beat the egg white until it has *coarse bubbles*, add ** first portion of white sugar**
* Egg beating device at high speed, beat the egg whites until the bubbles are more delicate*, add ** second portion of white sugar**
* Egg beating device at high speed, beat the egg white to a state of *"wet foaming" (at this time, lift the head of the egg beating device, with long curved sharp corners), add **third portion of white sugar**
* At medium and low speed, beat the egg white to a "dry foaming" state (lift the head of the egg white to have a short and upright sharp corner; press the container upside down, the egg white can stick to the container and not fall off)
* At this time, the degree of egg whitening has met the requirements
* For judging protein status, please refer to the pictures in the attachment link.)
* The egg beater should be as close to the bottom of the container as possible to prevent the surface floating on it from being beaten and the bottom is still liquid)

### Mix and stir

* Stir the egg yolk liquid briefly
* Use a spatula to take **1/3** meringue and add it to the egg yolk paste
* Use the "frying" technique, which is to avoid defoaming
* The stirring method is
* First, use your right hand to insert the batter from the center of the mixing basin to the bottom of the batter
* Scrape at 8 o'clock until it hits the wall of the basin, scoop up the batter and lift it into the air, then move it back to the center of the basin and put the batter into the basin.
* Hold the mixing bowl with your left hand and turn it from 9 o'clock to 7 o'clock. It just rotated 60 degrees and completed a cycle.
* The speed is about 1 second
* This method comes from "Teacher Kojima's Cake Classroom".In down-to-earth terms, stir-fry like stir-frying.
* Pour the mixture of **1/3** melon and egg yolk into the remaining **2/3** melon and continue to stir evenly
* Pour the cake batter into the mold and shake it a few times to avoid air bubbles

### Baking

* Total baking time: 6-inch cake **30-35** minutes, 8-inch cake **50** minutes.Flexible adjustments are made according to the characteristics of your own oven, generally no more than $\pm 5$ minutes.(You can observe in front of the oven in the last few minutes)
*Preheat and bake with **150** upper tube and **160** lower tube and **160** Celsius** preheat and bake, and it will reach the predetermined temperature in about 10 minutes.
* After preheating is completed, put the mold into the lower layer of the oven
* Choose **Change temperature baking**, which is divided into two stages.
* The oven setting temperature in the first stage is: upper tube **150** degrees Celsius, lower tube **160** degrees Celsius;
* Before the total baking time **3/5** is the first stage baking
* The temperature in the second stage is: upper tube **160** degrees Celsius, lower tube **170** degrees Celsius;
* After the total baking time **2/5** is the second stage of baking.Directly adjust the oven temperature to switch.
* After baking, come out
* This operation may be hot and hot, please use towels to assist

### Cooling and demolding

- (Optional) Drop the mold from a high place and shake out the hot air in it
- The mold is upside down for 10 minutes to cool the cake
- Cakes without cooling will be removed immediately and will damage the cake
- This operation may be hot and hot, please use towels to assist
- Demold, eat

## Additional content

- Refer to the following tutorial, which explains very detailed and has a picture of each step.At the same time, there are explanations for why a certain operation is done, the principles behind it, and analysis of certain problems:
- [In order to make this chiffon cake, I used a whole box of eggs and bid farewell to the concave bottom and collapse from then on](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/86865919)
- For chiffon cakes, whipping egg whites is a secondary issue, the key is the temperature and time when baking.
- For egg white containers, there may be water droplets, but egg yolk containers cannot.
- Reason: Oil will affect the beating of the egg white. 85% of the egg white is water, and a slight drop of water does not affect the beating of the egg white.
- Especially fresh egg whites will be harder. If you deal with hard egg whites, add 15ml of water to help beat the egg whites (1 egg recipe is 3g of water)
- The sugar added during the way to beat the egg white is actually melted into the water in the egg white, becoming a syrup solution wrapped outside the bubbles, which protects the beaten bubbles.
- The temperature has a great impact on the rate and solubility of sugar melting into water, and the egg whites just taken out of the refrigerator are not easy to beat.However, eggs with lower temperatures are easy to separate egg whites and yolks. It is recommended to regain room temperature and then whisk after separation.
