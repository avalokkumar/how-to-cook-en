- Prepare the pig's front hooves, ask the master to split it from the middle when buying groceries, use a sprinkler to remove the hair follicles, and take it home to clean
- Add pig's trotters, green onion slices, ginger slices, and cooking wine to a cold water pot, blanch for ten minutes, skim off the foam, remove and wash and set aside
- Put pig's trotters, angelica, angelica, white pepper, and ginger slices into the pressure cooker. Press after sprinting for 30 minutes, add white kidney beans, and press for another ten minutes.
