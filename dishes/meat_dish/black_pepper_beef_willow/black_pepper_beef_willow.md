- Salt
- Peanut Oil

## calculate

You need to determine how many copies you plan to make before each production.One serving is just enough 2-3 for personal consumption

Total quantity:

- Beef volume = serving number * 100 grams (increased and decreased according to the stomach capacity and pot capacity of the diner)
- Onion quantity = number of servings * 1/12 pieces (i.e. about 1/4 cut for 3 people)
- The amount of pepper = number of servings * 1/12 pieces (i.e. about 1/4 cut for 3 people)
- Salt amount = number of servings * 1 g
- Starch = Number of servings * 3 grams
- Black pepper marinade = marinate in proportion according to the instructions of the purchased product
- Black pepper = serving * 1 g (actually sprinkle)
- Peanut oil = number of servings * 10ml (actually the amount of oil varies according to the amount of dishes. If there is an increase or decrease in the amount of beef, please change according to the corresponding proportion)

Using the above conditions, calculate the proportion of raw materials planned to be used.

## operate

- Cut the beef into strips, the length is best controlled below 8 cm, the thickness is about 5-10 mm, and the width is about 1 cm (not strict)
- Use marinade to marinate the beef, mix evenly and let it stand. Please refer to the product instructions for the dosage and time, which can be extended but not shortened.
- If using liquid marinade, sprinkle a layer of black pepper three minutes before the marinade, then add the starch, mix again and let stand for 20 minutes.
- Turn on the heat, heat the pan, and add peanut oil.
- When you can see a trace of smoke coming out of the oil in the pan, add the beef and stir-fry.
- Turn on medium heat and stir-fry for 2 minutes until the beef changes color (that is, there is no obvious blood color, and the blood color part means that the stir-fry is not in place) (Be careful of oil dripping sputtering here).
- Add onion and pepper and stir fry for 2 minutes.
- Add salt, sprinkle a portion of black pepper again, stir fry for 30 seconds, stirring well.
- Observe that the onions have become soft, turn off the heat, take it out of the pot, and serve it on the plate.
