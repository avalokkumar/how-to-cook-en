## calculate

Note that this dish has only 3 or more people (fish that are too big or too small are not suitable), so there is no formula calculation required, and it is especially suitable for eating during family dinners, such as New Year's Eve dinner.

- Carp = about 3 catties
- Qingshui = 50g
- Tomato sauce = 40g
- White sugar = 20g
- White vinegar = 10g
- Starch = 10g
- Salt = 30g
- Green onion = 30g (about half a piece)
- Ginger = 30g
- Cooking wine = 25g

## operate

- Clean the fish to ensure there are no foreign objects such as fish scales
- Hold the fish head to the left, the fish belly to the down, and hold the knife in the right hand.Cut the knife vertically 1cm, press the fish body tightly to the left 3-4cm, and then gently cut the middle of the fish fillet
- Put the fish in a basin, then slice the ginger and cut the green onion into pieces (just cut it casually, mainly to remove the fishy smell)
- Use the strength of eating milk to squeeze the juice from the green onions and ginger into the basin
- Add 20g salt and 25g cooking wine, then rub the carp and apply evenly

(The longer the fish is pickled, the smaller the fish smell. It is recommended to pickle for more than 30 minutes)

- Find a clean basin, add 100g flour, 200g starch, 180g water, 5g salt, and stir it evenly with your hands. The batter is sticky and brushable at this time, then beat an egg and stir evenly again
- Wait 30 minutes
- Place the fish on the chopping board and use a dry towel to dry the water on the fish (this can make it better to hang the paste)
- Rinse the basin and wipe it dry with a dry towel
- Fry the oil in the pan, add about 1L of oil, and heat the oil to 70% heat, about 200-240 degrees
- Pinch the tail of the fish, sink the fish head into the bottom of the pot, use a spoon to heat oil on the fish body, and after the batter is formed, slowly put the fish into the pot, use a spatula to gently shovel the fish's head, and then put it on a zipper.Prevent the bottom from frying.
- Prepare a plate for fish and place it next to the pot.
- Use a spatula to gently shovel the fish body, and turn the two tools together with the fish to turn over.Fry for two more minutes, the same way (the fence holds the fish head, the spatula holds the fish body, and puts the fish on the plate)
- Pour the oil from the pot into a dry basin, place it aside, and brush the pot clean
- Put 50g water, 40g tomato sauce, 20g sugar, and 10g white vinegar into a small bowl and stir well
- Prepare a small bowl and add 10g starch and 10g water, stir to water starch
- Turn on high heat to heat the pot, then pour in the prepared sauce, boil over high heat, and turn to low heat
- Add the prepared water starch, stir while pouring, then turn off the heat after 20 seconds
- Pour the cooked sweet and sour sauce evenly on the fish with a spoon. You can add some coriander or chopped green onion, and the sweet and sour carp will be ready.
