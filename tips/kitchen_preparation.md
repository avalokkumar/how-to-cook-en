```

If you really want to pursue formality, standardization and ritual, and want to have a unique and interesting kitchen, purchase the following:

```text

```

If you want to save time, you can buy semi-finished products and simply process them and eat them:

```text
Pre-fried fried chicken nuggets, frozen hand-catch cakes, wrapped dumplings, bagged curry, various bowls (rice bowls), self-heating food, mixed fabric bags, takeaway bags, convenience foods
```

For other raw materials for each dish, please refer to the `Required Raw Materials` section of the dish itself.

## Buy oil

Before purchasing oil, you need to know some basic knowledge about fatty acids

### Fatty acid classification

Fatty acids are divided into:

* Saturated fatty acids (avoid as much as possible)
* Unsaturated fatty acids
* Cis fatty acids
* Trans fatty acids (especially avoided)
* Polyunsaturated fatty acids
* Monounsaturated fatty acids

Saturated fatty acids will be solid at room temperature, while unsaturated fatty acids will be liquid at room temperature.

### Fatty acids to avoid

Among them, **saturated fatty acids** and **trans fatty acids** are generally considered unhealthy.

Saturated fatty acids can increase the risk of obesity, high cholesterol, and heart disease.

Pay special attention to trans fatty acids, as it increases LDL cholesterol in the blood and also reduces HDL cholesterol, thereby increasing the risk of heart disease.

### Trans fatty acids for snacks

The items in the following ingredients list are higher than those that may contain trans fatty acids:

* Hydrogenated vegetable oil
* Shortening
* Margarine
* Plant butter
* Hydrogenated fat
* Plant cream
* Refined vegetable oil

But some high-quality snacks do not contain trans fatty acids.The actual content of `trans fat` marked in the nutritional content of snacks shall prevail.

### Trans fatty acids in oil

Although many snacks contain trans fatty acids, more sources are not hydrogenation, but produced during processing.

The main processing sources of trans fatty acids are:

* Vegetable oil (main source)
* Pastry
* biscuit
* Fried food
* bread

Vegetable oils include:

* Rapeseed oil
* Tea seed oil
* Soybean oil
* Mix oil
* Olive oil
* Peanut oil
* Sunflower oil
* Corn oil
* Sesame oil
* Palm oil
* Coconut oil
* Cottonseed oil
* Canola Oil

They all contain small amounts of trans fatty acids because deodorization is required during refining at high temperatures.

The trans fatty acids of commercially available high-quality vegetable oils are generally between 0% and 3%. With the continuous innovation of oil products, the content of trans fatty acids is also decreasing.

And the real source of trans fatty acids is the cooking process:

Vegetable oils often contain a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have poor thermal stability and are easily converted into trans fat at high temperatures.

Therefore, in different scenarios, we need to choose oil products reasonably and minimize the heating time of oil products as much as possible.

### Selection of vegetable oil

| Oil Name | Saturated Fatty Acids (%) | Omega 3 (%) | Omega 6 (%) | Omega 9 (%) |
| :---: | :----: | :----: | :---: | :---: |
| Canola Oil | 7% | 11% | 21% | 61% |
| Flaxseed Oil | 9% | 57% | 16% | 18% |
| Sunflower Oil | 12% | 1% | 71% | 16% |
| Corn Oil | 13% | 1% | 57% | 29% |
| Olive Oil | 15% | 1% | 9% | 75% |
| Soybean Oil | 15% | 8% | 54% | 23% |
| Peanut Oil | 19% | 0% | 33% | 48% |
| Cottonseed Oil | 27% | 0% | 54% | 19% |
| Lard | 43% | 1% | 9% | 47% |
| Palm Oil | 51% | 0% | 10% | 39% |
| Butter | 68% | 1% | 3% | 28% |
| Coconut Oil | 91% | 0% | 2% | 7% |

* `Peanut oil` is rich in `monounsaturated fat`.But it is recommended to choose high-quality ones only.When processing, be careful not to heat it for too long to avoid the production of `trans fatty acids`.
* Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, which has only one unsaturated bond.Olive oil has low content of `saturated fatty acids`.But it is recommended to choose high-quality ones only.When processing, be careful not to heat it for too long to avoid producing trans fatty acids.
* `Soybean oil` does not contain `saturated fatty acids` and contains linoleic acid and vitamins.However, soybean oil is unstable and is prone to produce `trans fatty acids` during processing. Therefore, it is not recommended to eat it for a long time and can be used for cold dishes.
* `Raise oil has good thermal stability and is rich in `polyunsaturated fatty acids`, but may contain erucic acid, which may cause fat deposition and heart damage.Rapeseed oil lacks linoleic acid, has low nutritional value and is prone to spoilage.
* The `saturated fatty acids of `coconut oil` are very high and have good thermal stability, but be careful that some foods will use hydrogenated coconut oil.Suitable for frying in the kitchen, regular consumption will increase the risk of obesity.
* Palm oil has very high saturated fatty acids and are highly thermally stable. Regular consumption will increase the risk of high cholesterol.
* Animal oils such as `lard`, `butter` are rich in `saturated fatty acids`, and regular consumption will increase the risk of high cholesterol.Not recommended for long-term consumption.

Therefore, based on the above table, we can draw some conclusions:

* No oil is perfect, and every oil has its advantages and disadvantages.Therefore, we should choose different oils according to different cooking scenes.
* The same type of oil should not be used at all times. Different oils should be selected according to different cooking scenarios to ensure balanced nutrition.
* In order not to consume too much `Trans fatty acids`.When heating, do not choose oils that are unstable in heat, and do not heat them for too long.
* Do not eat fried food in large quantities.Oils with good thermal stability often contain a large amount of "saturated fatty acids" and are not suitable for long-term consumption.
* Do not reuse oil.During the heating process, oil products will produce a large amount of `trans fatty acids`.
* Don’t eat takeaway food for a long time, because it’s hard to determine what oil they are using.

#### Frying oil

* Peanut oil (choose high oil quality)
* Olive oil (choose high oil quality)
* Rapeseed oil (select low erucic acid)

Peanut oil, olive oil, and rapeseed oil contain more unsaturated fatty acids and less saturated fatty acids.However, its thermal stability is poor and it is easy to produce trans fatty acids during heating.Therefore, be careful to control the heating time and do not heat it too long.

#### Frying oil

* Coconut oil
* Palm oil
* butter
* Lard

When stir-frying and frying, oils with better thermal stability need to be used, such as coconut oil, palm oil, and butter.They produce fewer trans fatty acids.However, they have a high content of saturated fatty acids and are not suitable for long-term consumption.

#### Cold stir, stew oil

* Flaxseed oil
* Sesame oil
* Walnut oil
* Perilla oil

This type of scenario does not require heating, so no trans fatty acids are produced.Don't choose oils with too many saturated fatty acids.
