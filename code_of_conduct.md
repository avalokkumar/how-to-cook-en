# Code of Conduct

##Why do we insist on maintaining this warehouse

Many friends asked me why I need to maintain this warehouse? Why stick to accurate recipes?How do you plan to develop this warehouse in the future?Do you want to monetize traffic?I ​​want to give my (@Anduin2017) my own answer here and clarify the values ​​​​​​of contribution.

We have strong infrastructure construction capabilities.For example: we have fitness apps, bracelets, medical platforms, grocery shopping platforms, takeaway platforms, smart refrigerators, smart scales, smart treadmills, etc. But I always need to spend a lot of energy to deal with and calculate between them.These infrastructures have particularly poor communication skills with each other.

I once imagined that in the future world, human beings no longer need to care about food, rice, oil and salt, and the problem of what to eat will be completely solved.Our daily behavior can be completely given by the computer.

For example: The doctor advised me to lose 15 kilograms in 50 days.Then these applications will be linked to the conclusions of the medical platform.I designed a fitness plan for me, automatically calculate the food I should eat, automatically order the missing things in the refrigerator, automatically avoid expired, automatically calculate the recommended meals, automatically calculate the calorie intake and consumption,automatically that I eat enough and delicious and can meet my health requirements, and automatically correct according to the results measured by my scale, etc.

This is an ideal life management system.It requires a lot of infrastructure integration to truly realize that you don’t need to worry about these things and just focus on what you love.As for what to eat every day, what time to eat, how much to eat, how to eat, how to eat healthy, how to fulfill my fitness requirements, how to meet the doctor's advice, etc., just let the computer help everyone get everythingdone.

Perhaps, building such a life-healthy system is extremely costly and difficult to make a profit.We are still focusing on solving problems: we go to the hospital after encountering a disease, and no program really helps me manage my health.

Of course, there must be an ideal, and I hope that one day computers can help humans eliminate diseases.At that time, I hoped that my warehouse could be a reliable and powerful screw in this complex life system, faithfully shouldering its original mission:

> Provide a recipe that is accurate enough.

For additional additional functions development, visualization, intelligence, platform docking, catering industry, etc., the recipes in this warehouse can be referenced for secondary development.

## Warehouse Principles

The development principle of warehouses: maintain its precise characteristics, ensure reading as much as possible while unifying the format, and facilitate secondary development.

### Weak protocol

I hope there can be commercial companies, hotels, enterprises or scientific research institutions that can reference this warehouse.So it will always stick to a weaker license agreement.It will serve as an infrastructure and be used in more and more complex products and scenarios in the future.

Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell or distribution in the form of a recipe or dish, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes, and any means.

### Be as formal as possible

As formal as possible, including unified recipe file formats, avoid inaccurate units and operations (especially computers cannot understand), and maintain a clear directory structure, etc.

Many contributors complain: It is too difficult to sign in the recipe and the requirements are too cumbersome.But in fact, this recipe is not for human reading, but more likely to be processed by machines.

We must ensure that different people can get almost the same results by cooking according to the same recipe.

### Non-commercial

HowToCook will never insert ads, avoiding the materials in the recipe from being coupled to specific brands as much as possible, and using easily accessible raw materials as possible.

HowToCook will never discuss monetization issues.And always maintained by the community.

### AI Friendly

The community can use this warehouse to train any type of AI and allow commercial use.

## Derivatives

Currently, there are many mini programs, apps, websites, etc. in the community based on HowToCook secondary development.

HowToCook Warehouse has no cooperative relationship or obligation to know any derivatives.The code of conduct for all derivatives is not subject to the code of conduct of HowToCook and does not represent the values ​​​​​​of HowToCook warehouses.
