- Kill the fish with the back (let the fish sellers kill them well, never cut off the caesarean section, remember to open the back), clean it
- Spread the surface of the fish evenly with salt, pour about 80ml of cooking wine and 20g of minced ginger, put it in the refrigerator for freshness layer and marinate for 1-2 days
- Take out the pickled fish, hang it with a rope and dry it until half dry (about 1-2 days, the specific time must be combined with temperature and sunlight)
- Please wash the fish with clean water before eating and drain the water (to prevent water from splashing with oil)
- Turn on high heat to heat the pot, quickly reduce the heat, add oil to the pot, try to keep oil on the entire pot surface, and strip the fish along the edge of the pot into the pot (fry the back of the fish first)
- After the fish is put into the pot (and after turning), do not rush to move the fish position (it is easy to break the skin at this time). After frying for about 30 seconds, try shaking the pot
- Fry on the back for about 1 minute, fry for about 1-2 minutes, fry until both sides are golden brown
- When both sides are fried, push the fish to the side of the pot, leave some space to add bean paste to stir-fry the aroma, add ginger and garlic.

- At this time, change to medium-high heat and cook for 5-10 minutes. Then add green peppers, white sugar, chicken essence, thirteen aromas, and aged vinegar.
- Replace the heat for 2-5 minutes, add the scallions and coriander, and then it will be served

## Additional content

- Remember that fish is killed by the back. When marinating, apply salt evenly on the surface of the fish. The marination time and drying time are 1-2 days.
- Fry the fish at low heat throughout the whole process. Do not move the fish when it is just put into the pot, as it will break the skin
- After putting the green peppers in apart, please pay attention to the degree of ripening. The green peppers inside are delicious, and then add the coriander at the end
- Pay attention to the switching of heat, the freshness of bean paste and sugar, and the fragrance-enhancing effect of aged vinegar
