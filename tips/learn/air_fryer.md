# Use an air fryer

## What is an air fryer

An air fryer is an electronic cooking utensil that uses air to heat the original hot oil, so that the food can be cooked and the ingredients can achieve an effect similar to the fried food without encountering oil.

### How to work

The air fryer generates high-temperature hot air through the heater above, allowing the hot air to circulate around the food, quickly heats the food's own oil, takes away the food's moisture, produces a fried effect, and creates a crispy feeling similar to fried food.

### advantage

* Since there is no need to add cooking oil, you can significantly reduce the intake of cooking oils containing high amounts of fat and calories.
* The hot air at high speed circulating dehydrates the food, making the surface golden and crispy, making the food burnt on the outside and tender on the inside.
* Simple operation and friendly to newcomers.

## process

* Place the air fryer on a solid, flat and horizontal insulation surface.
* Remove the frying pan, put the ingredients into the frying basket, and slide the frying pan into the product.
* Modify the preset temperature and turn the knob to adjust the cooking time.
* After adjusting the cooking time, the product will start cooking and wait for the cooking to be completed when the timer rings.
* Pour all the food in the frying basket into a bowl or dish.Be sure to remove the frying basket containing the ingredients from the skillet you are using, as hot oil or grease may remain on the bottom of the skillet.

## Notes

* When using an air fryer, be careful not to set the temperature too high (try to within 120℃, preferably not exceeding 168℃), and the production time should not be too long (about 10 minutes), so as to avoid the formation of too many harmful ingredients [acrylamide] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%99%E7%83%AF%E9%85%B0%E8%83%BA).
* Reduce the intake of starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, fried dough sticks, etc. in an air fryer, which can reduce the intake of [acrylamide] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%99%E7%83%AF%E9%85%B0%E8%83%BA).Relatively speaking, air fryers are suitable for cooking foods with higher fat or moisture content, such as meat and vegetables.
* During use, the air inlet on the top and the air outlet on the back cannot be blocked.If you cover it with your hands, you may be scalded by the hot air.
