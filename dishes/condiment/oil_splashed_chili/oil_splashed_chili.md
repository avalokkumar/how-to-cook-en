## operate

- Take out the garlic and break it and peel it.
- Take out the chopping board and chop `small garlic`, `small pepper`
- Take out the bowl and pour in `peanut oil`
- Put the oil in `other ingredients` and `scalls`, wait until the spices are zoomed, take them out and throw them away
- Take out the iron pan and put the oil in the bowl and heat it for 2 minutes (burn the rapeseed oil until it smokes)
- This is an empty bowl
- Add `dried chili noodles`, `white sesame`, `minced garlic`, `milled rice pepper`, `salt`, `five spice powder`, and `grass` to the empty bowl as "seasoning"
- Turn off the heat and cool the oil temperature to `210` Celsius
- Pour the hot oil in the pot into the bowl and stir with a spoon (you can add the same "seasoning" bowl at `165`C to finally mix and increase the spicy)
- Pour in hot oil and stir slightly, and add white vinegar, which will boil again.Continue stirring, and the white vinegar adds fragrance.
- Cool the chili oil until warm and add sugar and MSG. The sugar can be spicy and soft, and will not be so choking.
