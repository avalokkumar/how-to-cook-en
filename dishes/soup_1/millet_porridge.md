# How to make millet porridge

Xiaomi contains a variety of vitamins, amino acids, fats and carbohydrates, and has high nutritional value. Every 100 grams of millet contains 9.7 grams of protein and 3.5 grams of fat, which is not lower than rice and wheat.

Generally, the carotene is not contained in grains, and the content of millet is 0.12 mg per 100 grams, and the content of vitamin B1 ranks first among all grains.

Millet is also very sugary, with 72.8 grams of sugar per 100 grams, and the calorie production is much higher than that of rice.In addition, Xiaomi is also rich in vitamins B1, B2, etc.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

## Essential raw materials and tools

- Millet
- Water (the best mountain spring water)

## calculate

- Xiaomi 100g
- Water (the best mountain spring water) 2000 grams

Using the above conditions, calculate the proportion of raw materials planned to be used.

## operate

* 100 grams of millet, put it in a bowl, wash it lightly with water (mix it with your hands and pour out the water, just remove the floating ash outside, do not rub it!!!)
* The water boils, be sure to boil!!!
* When the water boils, pour the millet into the pot.(An important part that is easy to be overlooked)
* Stir so that the millet will not stick to the bottom of the pot. Continue to simmer over high heat for 6-10 minutes, pay attention to stirring several times with the middle.
* Change to medium heat and low heat for 15-20 minutes. The lid should be staggered by one seam. Never let the millet oil slip away. Keep stirring a few times in the middle and do not paste the bottom of the pot.

## Additional content

* This is made in a regular pot (it takes only 30-35 minutes to come out of the pot) and the taste is the best.Pressure cookers and rice cookers are easy to deal with, but the effect is reduced, and the amount of water should be appropriately reduced. Generally, 100 grams of millet + 1800 grams of water
* Xiaomi only needs to use water to remove floating ash. Never waste it too much, as it will lose Xiaomi oil.
* Remember that millet needs to be put into the pot when the water is boiling
* I don't like to add alkali, I prefer the original flavor of millet
