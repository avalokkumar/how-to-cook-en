# Use a microwave

## What is a microwave oven

The microwave was invented in 1945 by [Percy Lebaran Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Spencer).

When he was a radar system engineer, he discovered that the chocolate bar in his pocket began to melt as soon as the radar was turned on, resulting in the idea and invention.

### How to work

The electromagnetic waves produced by the magnetron during microwaves at a frequency of 2.45 billion Hz, which will cause molecules of water and oil to vibrate and heat.

## process

The microwave works quite well in many cooking tasks.

Strong fire is suitable for:

* [Cooking] Cooking vegetables
* [Cooking] Soften hard vegetables with high moisture content (such as potatoes, onions and artichokes)
* [Puffed] Popular snacks, such as puffs, Indian Papadam Crispies, Popcorn

Medium fire is suitable for:

* [Cooking] Seafood (e.g. [microwash onion ginger black cod](../../dishes/aquatic/microwash onion ginger black cod.md))
* [Cooking] Soften meat
* [Dehydration] Dried fruit and vegetable peels
* [Dehydration] Make dried meat
* [Fried] Fried crispy spice plants
* [Fried] Soften leafy vegetables
* [Heat] Heat leftovers

Weak fire is used for:

* [Thaw] Thaw food
* [Thaw] Melt butter and chocolate

## Notes

* Microwave ovens should not be used to heat water, which may cause it to boil and have a certain impact on your personal safety.
* Absolutely do not use the microwave to heat eggs!Unless it is a **shelled** raw** egg and needs to poke the yolk.Because heating will cause the gas inside the egg to expand, causing an explosion.
* No matter what purpose you are for, even if you are curious, you should not use a microwave to heat the complete fruit (such as grapes, blueberries, cherry tomatoes), which may make it explode
* Since the microwave wavelength is 12.2 cm, the microwave oven heats small objects slower than large objects.Therefore, if it is a small food, it is recommended to gather it together for heating.
* The microwave can only penetrate a few centimeters deep into the food, so sometimes it is very hot on the outside and may still be cold on the inside.The solution is to put the ingredients and a small amount of liquid into the sealed bag, or put them in a bowl and cover them with plastic wrap to create enough steam in the container to make up for the disadvantage of the microwave's uneven cooking.
* tips: Beware of steam spraying when opening the sealed bag
* Microwaves can only heat objects containing liquid molecules such as water and oil, so neither plastic wrap nor sealed bags are microwaved.
* Metal can reflect microwaves without being heated. Please avoid using containers containing gold edges and metal patterns to avoid uneven heat causing the container to break.Be sure to use a porcelain, glass container or a special baking tray for microwaves.
