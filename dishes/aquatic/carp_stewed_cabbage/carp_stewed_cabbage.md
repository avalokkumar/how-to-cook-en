- Add oil to the pot, wait until the oil is hot, add "less salt", "ginger", "garlic", "Pixian bean paste", "cinnamon" and "star anise" to stir-fry to bring out the fragrance
- Fry the fish in a pot (3 minutes) and turn it every (30 seconds)
- Add "water" (try to be as good as possible to be as low as the fish) Add "smooth soy sauce", "dark soy sauce", "baby cabbage"
