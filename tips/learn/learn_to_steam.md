# Steam

## Way

### Steaming pot

The steamer is a multi-layer structure, and the bottom is used to hold water. It uses the heat of the water vapor generated after the water boils to heat the upper layer of food.

Add appropriate amount of water to the bottom layer of the steamer - put the food in the upper steamer - put the steamer on the heat and heat it

### Iron pot

If there is no steamer, only a normal iron pan (non-frying pan), you can place a tripod on the bottom of the pan and inject enough water to achieve a steamer-like effect.

Add enough water to the bottom of the iron pot——Put it into a tripod——Place the food on the tripod——Open the fire and close the cover

## Notes

* Because the heat source is water vapor, the bottom of the food in the lower steamer may be soaked in water.This can be avoided by placing a steamer cloth under the food.It is also OK to use chopsticks to put food on a simple stand.
* You can use smart devices to set a timer to remind you to turn off the fire to prevent forgetting and burning dry.
* In the process of making food with a steamer, you need to pay attention to the amount of water remaining in the bottom area, especially the iron pot, to avoid drying the pot and causing safety problems.
* (Optional) When using an iron pot to steam food, you can place a steaming dish on top of the tripod.
