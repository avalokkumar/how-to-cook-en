# Get rid of the fishy smell

Removing fishy food is a process during cooking.

Removing fishy smell refers to removing the fishy smell in meat, aquatic products and other foods through methods including but not limited to adding seasonings, blanching, etc.

**Free smell is the source of flavor of certain foods. Excessive removal of fishy smell may lead to food losing its flavor.**

There are many ways to remove fishy fish, and you should choose flexibly in cooking projects.

## Means

### Add seasoning

Adding seasonings to ingredients is the easiest way to remove fishy smells.For example, for most dishes that use egg liquid ([egg custard](../../dishes/vegetable_dish/egg custard/egg custard.md), [scrambled eggs with tomatoes](../../dishes/vegetable_dish/ tomatoes.md)), you can add salt, cooking wine, vinegar and other seasonings to remove the fishy smell during the process of making the egg liquid.

When cooking certain meats, you can add pepper, star anise, bay leaves, cinnamon, cumin, chili and other spices to the soup base to remove the fishy smell.

The finished spicy hot pot base has an extremely strong aroma and can be added in moderation during cooking, enough to cover the fishy smell of most meats.

### Dipping

Some foods still have a serious smell after cooking.You can mix dipping sauce to cover up the fishy smell when eaten.

Common dipping ingredients include: vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, bean paste, sweet noodle sauce, sesame paste, peanut butter, fermented tofu, salt, garlic, ginger, etc.

Various dipping sauces are matched in a matter of opinion, so I wonâ€™t give an example here.

### Stir-fried pot

During the cooking process, you can use spices such as green onion, ginger, garlic, dried chili and other spices to stir-fry.The aromatic substances in the spices evaporate under the action of high temperatures, which can cover the fishy smell to a certain extent and increase the flavor of the dish.

### Blanch in cold water

Some animal raw materials contain blood, such as chicken, pig's trotters, pork ribs, etc.If the residual blood is not removed, it will cause a certain fishy smell to the dish.

When cold water is put into the pot, the remaining blood will disperse into the water; as the temperature rises, the protein in the blood coagulates, and the blood originally scattered in the water forms a foam floating on the water surface.At this time, just skim the foam with a spoon to remove the fishy smell. The remaining clear soup can be used as the soup base for stewing vegetables to continue cooking.

### Notes

- When blanching, some seasonings are often added to the pot, such as: pepper, star anise, cooking wine, green onions, etc., to further strengthen the effect of removing fishy smell.
- Star anise fragrance is strong, and it should be added in moderation
- Pepper and pepper are small in size and large in addition, and may remain in the pot or even remain until the finished dish after adding. You can wrap a seasoning bag with gauze or use a food-grade stainless steel seasoning box to easily pick it out before the finished dish.
