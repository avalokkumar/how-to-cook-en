#Fry/fry

## Equipment

Can be used in a normal metal (iron/stainless steel/aluminum) frying/scratch or non-stick pan.

Aluminum containers are not recommended. For details, please refer to the Food Safety Section

### Notes

* Methods to stir-fry dishes with a normal pot:

#### Scramble eggs first

* No matter what dish you cook, stir-fry the eggs, donâ€™t brush the pot after stir-frying, and then the dish will not stick when stir-frying.

####Hot pan cooling method

* Remember to heat the pan and cool the oil first
* Put nothing in a clean pot, boil it dry to make it evenly heat it, heat it
* Add cool oil and rotate the pan to make the oil stain the entire pan (you can rotate it back and forth to make it evenly heated)
* When you see gas coming out of the pot, it means that the oil in the pot has been heated
* Pour out the oil, do not brush the pot after pouring it out
* You can repeat the above steps 2-3 times to get a better non-stick effect
* Note: If it is gas, it may spit fire, be careful

####Hot pot double oil method

* First, heat the pot
* Put nothing in a clean pot, boil it dry to make it evenly heat it, heat it
* Add "a small amount of cool oil" and rotate the pan to make the oil stain the entire pan (can rotate back and forth to make it heat evenly)
* When you see gas coming out of the pot, it means that the oil in the pot has been heated
* Continue to add cool oil and start cooking
* Note: If it is gas, it may spit fire, so be careful.

Replenish:

* The purpose is to hang oil all over the bottom of the pot. All household pots on the market are suitable for it. After hanging the oil, it becomes a non-stick pot in seconds.
* Use a non-stick pan to fry food and won't stick to the pan.The function of a non-stick pan comes from the coating on its inner wall.**Metal spatula will scratch the coating.When using a nonstick pan, use a wooden or silicone spatula to avoid damage to the coating.**

### process

Turn on the fire - directly place the pan flat on the heat, heat it - pour the oil into the pan, heat it - put the dishes and stir-fry - remember to put seasonings before leaving the pan

### Notes

* When determining whether the pan/oil is hot, you can place your hands flat on the top of the pan to feel the heat; the ingredients can be added after the oil is hot.
* Before pouring oil into the pan, be sure to make sure there is no residual moisture inside the pan.**Water can cause hot oil to splash, causing danger.**
* Follow the previous strip, before putting the ingredients in the oil pan, drain the water (the egg liquid is fine); similarly, do not put unfreeze ingredients in the oil pan to avoid causing danger after ice melting.
* **If the oil pan catches fire, do not pour water to extinguish the fire**.Doing so will increase the fire.When the fire just starts, you can quickly turn off the heat and cover the pot.
