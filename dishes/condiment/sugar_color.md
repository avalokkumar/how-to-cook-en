# How to make sugar

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential raw materials and tools

- Sugar (optional one):
- Rock sugar: The `sugar color` that is fried is the brightest and brightest, and it must be fried in water and oil. It will melt slowly without adding water.
- White sugar: Must be fried with water and oil, and it will melt slowly without adding water
- Mianbai sugar: You can do without water
- Don’t be too hot when stir-frying sugar color!!!The temperature of the induction cooker is not enough, and it will become bitter when the heat is too high, but it will become sweet enough

## calculate

- `Oil`: 100ml
- `Boiled Water`: 500ml
- `Sugar` (Take rock sugar as an example here)

## operate

- Turn on the fire and pour 100ml of boiling water into the pot
- Pour 100ml of oil into the pot, the shorter the interval from the first step, the better. At this time, the pot can be high and medium heat. If you are anxious, you can heat it up.
- Put rock sugar (if the rock sugar is too coupled, you can smash it in advance to make the lower the coupling degree, the better)
- Adjust the firepower to medium fire
- Start stirring
- Stir it all the time and turn it into tan, then ** turns to low heat**
- Be thinner again, turn black and brown, then turn red and then small bubbles appear. Be prepared to perform the following `operation 1`or`operation 2`
- Small bubbles will gradually disappear, and then large bubbles will appear. When the big bubbles appear, the sugar color will be completed
- You need to quickly perform the next operation at this time (no matter which operation, you must prepare it in advance and quickly! Otherwise, the heat will be too large and the sugar will become bitter), and make your choice based on the dish and personal taste.
- Operation 1: You can directly add 400ml of boiling water to reduce the temperature
- Operation 2: You can also add onion, ginger, garlic, pepper and other condiments to stir-fry
