- If you want to eat more, you can add fried tomatoes, diced onions, diced bacon, chopped cheese diced, etc. at the last step.(Anyway, something that won't come out of water again)
- Use a pan (non-stick pan).
- Considering that many people only fry one or two eggs for one person, a pot with a smaller diameter may be more convenient to stir evenly in the pot.
