# Steam (rice)/stew (using rice cooker/pressure cooker/pressure cooker)

## What is a pressure cooker

The pressure cooker is actually a normal pot with a lockable semi-sealed cover and a valve that can be used to control the pressure in the pot.

### How to work

The working method of a pressure cooker is to allow steam to accumulate in the pot and increase the pressure in the pot.When the pressure in the pot increases, the boiling point of water also increases, which can make the cooking temperature of water-containing food exceed 100 â„ƒ.

### advantage

* Because the actual cooking temperature of the pressure cooker is high, the cooking time can be greatly shortened.
* The high temperature inside the pressure cooker can promote browning and caramelization, creating a unique flavor.

## process

* Put the ingredients and water into the inner liner and close the lid to ensure that the pot body is sealed and heated.
*For foods with higher toughness, such as tendons, using a pressure cooker can easily cook them to achieve a better taste.
* Pressure cookers usually have a self-locking valve (float valve).During steaming, as the pressure in the pot increases, the self-locking valve will be activated and locked to isolate the gas inside and outside the pot, creating conditions for pressure-in-pressure in the pot.After the self-locking valve is started, the lid will also lock the pot to prevent force opening and play a safe role.During steaming, you need to make sure that the self-locking valve is not blocked by foreign objects and let the pressure cooker work normally.
* After switching to insulation state, the steam in the pot can be emptied through the exhaust valve before the lid can be opened.

### Notes

* **The water vapor is very hot, don't put it on the exhaust valve.**
*Do not manually exhaust the food while cooking liquid food, be careful to splash (you can put the ingredients in a sealed can or vacuum packaging bag and then cook with a pressure cooker).
* Cooking some dishes (such as soups) manually deflate** may affect the taste and taste of the food**.
* Make sure that the steam has been emptied before opening the cover.When opening the cover, do not open it all at once, especially when opening the cover, do not open the cover to the front of the person, to avoid steam burns.
* After the steaming is completed, as the air pressure in the pressure cooker drops to balance with the outside air pressure, the self-locking valve will be released.This can be used as a sign to determine whether the lid can be opened.
* The sealing of the pressure cooker depends on the sealing rubber ring in the lid. For old pressure cookers, it is necessary to check whether the sealing rubber ring is still effective.
* Make sure the rubber ring is completely clean and any particles stuck in it may damage the closed environment.
* Many pressure cookers have a safety line, and materials and liquids should not exceed this line. Too much food and liquid may cause water vapor to squirt and block the exhaust valve, or splash too much water vapor and not be difficult to clean.
* For a pressure cooker without a safety line, it is best not to let the water level line exceed 2/3 of the pot body.
* **Do not use pressure cookers to cook foods that are prone to foaming such as oats or noodles**.Foam may block the steam valve and pressure relief pipe.
* During the cooking process, when the pressure valve rises and steam or smoke is sprayed, it means that the pressure cooker is overpressurized. In order to ensure safety, the pressure valve releases excess pressure.Although the steam emitted has a strong aroma that will bring a higher sense of pleasure, the food taste will be lost, and the other hand, excessive pressure may cause the grooves of some types of pressure cookers to bend.Therefore, when steam is seen, the firepower can be reduced.
* tips: Opening the cover from the side is a good choice.
