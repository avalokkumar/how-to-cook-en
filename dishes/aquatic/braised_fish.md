## calculate

* Fish It is recommended that novices start with a medium-sized crucian carp and cut the flower knife in advance to facilitate maturity (or it will be easy to get rid of the fish on the back)
* Cut ginger into 2-3 slices of normal old ginger, and then slice the shreds.
* 3-4 garlic cloves, chop or slice
* 2-3 dried chili peppers (according to personal taste) chopped
* Coriander according to personal taste
* 10g of salt. If the chili pepper is hot, it is recommended to have more
* Vinegar 5ml
* Soy sauce 5ml
* White sugar 10g
* 1-2 onions, sprinkle onions normally
* 1-2 millet peppers, it’s okay not to put them. For those who have experienced it, put up at most 2, otherwise the spicy food will be too high and the chrysanthemums will be left untold.
*MSG, depending on personal taste, do not add too much, just 5g.
* Oyster sauce, 5g is the same as MSG
