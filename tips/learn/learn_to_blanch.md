###Blanch water in a pot

Blanch the boiling water pot, which means heating the water in the pot and then putting the ingredients into the pot.Turn it in time after putting it in the pot, and the time should be short and do not overheat.

This method is mostly used in plant-based raw materials, such as celery, spinach, lettuce, etc.Pay special attention to the heat when blanching. After a little longer, the color will become lighter and it will not be crisp or tender.Therefore, after putting it in the pot, the water can be removed and cooled when it is slightly opened.

- The raw materials of leafy vegetables should be blanched in water and then sliced ​​to avoid excessive loss of nutrients.
- When blanching, the water should be wide and the heat should be strong so that the raw materials can be put into the pot in time; when blanching green leafy vegetables, they should be rolled out and then removed.
- Vegetable raw materials should be put into cool immediately after blanching to prevent the residual heat from turning yellow and rotten.
- When blanching vegetables, you can add appropriate amount of salad oil such as peanut oil, corn oil, and soybean oil to keep it green.

### Blanch in cold water

Blanching the cold water pot means putting the raw materials into the pot at the same time as the cold water.The water must be overflowed with the raw materials and then boiled, with the purpose of maturing the raw materials and facilitating further processing.

Potatoes, carrots, etc. are not easy to mature due to their large size and need to be cooked for a longer time.

Some animal raw materials, such as white meat, beef 100-piece, beef tripe collar, etc., are further processed after being heated in cold water.Some animal ingredients used for cooking soup also need to be put into the pot with cold water, which gradually overflows during the heating process, making the soup delicious. If you use a hot water pot, it will cause protein coagulation.

- The amount of water added in the pot should not be too much, and the amount of water should be submerged.
- During the gradual heating process, the raw materials must be turned frequently to make the raw materials evenly heated and achieve the purpose of blanching.

## Additional Notes

- Blanching sometimes causes some unstable and soluble nutrients in the raw materials to spill, especially the water-soluble vitamins in fresh vegetables are more susceptible to loss.
- Blanch the raw materials of animals and plant materials separately; blanch the raw materials of heavy color and light color and taste respectively; blanch the large blocks and the small blocks separately to prevent each other from odor
- After blanching animal ingredients, the soup can be used as fresh soup after the foam is cleared

### Blanch the meat

- The meat ingredients are blanched in boiling water and change color. After draining the water, you can cook the next step.
- After blanching the meat, you need to wash away the attached blood foam stains. Remember to wash them with warm water, otherwise the meat will swell and contract, which will absorb the stains, resulting in the inability to wash the blood foam.

###Blanch vegetables

- When washing vegetables, sprinkle some salt in clean water to clean the insects in the vegetables
- The blanched vegetables should be immersed in cold water immediately to maintain color and taste.If you don't soak it in cold water, the vegetables will no longer become crisp and rotten because the residual heat of the boiling water will no longer be crisp and will feel like they are rotten because of the residual heat of the boiling water.
