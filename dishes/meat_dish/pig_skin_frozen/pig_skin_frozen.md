## Additional content

- When operating, you need to pay attention to making pig skin frozen and cooking directly into the pot will be "waste". It is also the most taboo. You must use white vinegar and salt to continuously rub the pig skin, so as to ensure that the cooked pig skin is crystal clear and has no fishy smell.
