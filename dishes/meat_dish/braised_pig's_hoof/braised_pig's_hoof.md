### Start making

* Add the chopped pig's trotters from the enthusiastic stall owner in the cold water pot, add 20 ml of cooking wine and green onion and ginger, and cook for 15 minutes to remove the blood
* Hot the pan and cool the oil, pour in 30ml of cooking oil, add 7-8 pieces of rock sugar, turn on low heat, and boil it into sugar color. During this period, crush the rock sugar with a spatula, and boil it for about 2 minutes.
* After boiling into sugar color, add the blanched pig's trotters, continue to heat up and stir-fry the pig's trotters until all the pig's trotters are slightly yellow on both sides.
* Add 2 bay leaves, 1 piece of cinnamon, 4 star anise, 20 ml of light soy sauce, 20 ml of dark soy sauce, 10 ml of cooking wine, 3 slices of ginger, and 8 grams of salt, turn to medium heat, continue stir-frying for 1 minute
* Add boiling water or cold water. The water needs to be covered with pig's trotters. Cover the pot and boil over high heat. Turn off the heat after boiling.
* Pour all the ingredients in the pot into the pressure cooker. It takes 15 minutes to put it in the pressure cooker (if the classmate does not have a pressure cooker, you can put it in the pot and turn it to low heat to boil it)
* After 15 minutes, pour the ingredients of the pressure cooker into the wok and turn on high heat to reduce the juice. At this time, you can use chopsticks to taste the taste. If it is light, add 2~3g of salt.
* The duration of juice collection on the high heat is calculated based on the water in the pot. Generally, it takes 30 seconds. It is okay to leave more. The braised pork trotter soup is also very good.
