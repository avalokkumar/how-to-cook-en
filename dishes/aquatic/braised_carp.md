## Additional content

For the following reasons, pork belly is needed to add to braised carp:

- Lard will be produced when stir-frying pork belly. Compared with vegetable oil, animal fat is more fragrant.
- Stir-fry until golden pork belly tastes very fragrant after stewing, which is equivalent to a side dish.
- Fish itself has little fat content, so they lack fragrance, and the emphasis is on the meaty taste.Therefore, it is recommended to use lard for fish dishes, and you want a pot of milky white and mellow fish soup.Lard is the best choice ~
