# cook

## process

Pour water into the pot - turn on the fire, heat the pot on the heat - boil the water (water rolls, a lot of bubbles appear) and put the ingredients

### Notes

* Cover the pot while heating to speed up heating.**But there is a risk of overflowing the pot**.After continuous heating, the transitional tumbling fluid may pop out of the pan, which is the spill.
* **If the pot is about to overflow, turn off the heat immediately and open the lid.**
* If you want to speed up the heat and avoid overflow of the pot, you can open the lid halfway to leave a gas outlet; you can also turn off the heat in the later stage and pay attention to the situation in the pot at all times.
* Depending on cooking needs, ingredients can also be put into the pot in cold water.But it takes longer to boil the water.
