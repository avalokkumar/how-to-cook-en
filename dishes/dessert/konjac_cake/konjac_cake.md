## operate

### Preheat oven

* Before preparing the cake batter, you can start preheating the oven to 350 ℉ (150 ℃) to save time

### Preliminary separation operation

* Remove fresh eggs from the refrigerator
* Prepare two containers and wipe dry them, and place egg white and egg yolk respectively
* For the container that holds egg white, there may be a little water droplets, but there should not be any oil; the container that holds egg yolks should not contain water droplets
* Beat the eggs, manually or using the egg splitter, separate the egg whites and the yolks into two containers.
* The egg yolks cannot be broken during separation, and no egg yolks can be mixed in the egg white, otherwise it will seriously affect the beating.(The white lace can enter the egg white without affecting it)
* (Note that when the kitchen machine is not used, the container for egg whites is also a container for beating. To avoid overflow, do not exceed **1/8** of the container after adding all egg whites)

### Puff away the egg whites

* Add 1g of tartar powder to egg white
* Egg beating device at high speed, beat the egg whites to the state of *coarse bubbles*, add 50g of erythritol
* At medium and low speed, beat the egg white to a state of *dry foaming* (lift the head of the egg white to have short and upright sharp corners; press the container upside down, the egg white can stick to the container and not fall off)
* At this time, the degree of egg whitening has met the requirements
* The egg beater should be as close to the bottom of the container as possible to prevent the surface floating on it from being beaten and the bottom is still liquid)

### Mix other ingredients

* Add the separated egg yolks to the whipped egg whites and stir evenly in the low speed of the egg whisk.
* Add **10g cocoa powder and **10g konjac powder to the egg white. First stir with a knife. This is because if you stir directly with an egg whisk, the powder will splash

* Hold the mixing bowl with your left hand and turn it from 9 o'clock to 7 o'clock. It just rotated 60 degrees and completed 1 cycle
* The speed is about 1 second 2 seconds
* This method comes from "Teacher Kojima's Cake Classroom".In down-to-earth terms, stir-fry like stir-frying.
* After the stirring is finished, stir evenly at low speed of the egg beater

### Baking

* Pour the cake batter into the mold, then smooth it with a dining knife, and then shake it a few times to avoid air bubbles
* Bake for 25 minutes
* After baking, wear insulation gloves and take it out

### Cooling and demolding
