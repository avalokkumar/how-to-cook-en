## pickled

Marinating meat before cooking is a common way to get meat pre-tasting.Generally, raw meat is used.According to the needs of the dishes, you can determine the size of the meat changer yourself.

For example, fried chicken and corn, chicken breasts are marinated after changing to small pieces of dice-sized pieces.
For example, roasted whole lamb, lamb legs, half a fan or whole lamb without changing the knife, you can apply a lot of seasoning on the surface to marinate and taste

Depending on the dish, the seasonings and auxiliary ingredients selected for pickling can be of any kind.Sometimes, for different flavors, the auxiliary ingredients may also need to be pre-treated.

## Basic concept of pickling

Here is a normal taste pickling process.

- Generally speaking, the larger the meat (such as 5kg of chicken wings with one-time marinated), the larger the volume (such as a whole lamb leg), and the heavier the taste, the more seasonings and auxiliary ingredients are needed
- Generally speaking, the longer the planned pickling time, the fewer seasonings and auxiliary ingredients are used
- When pickling, use ingredients to cover all surfaces evenly.If it is sliced ​​or shredded meat, you should try to grasp and stir evenly with your hands.If it is the whole leg of lamb, you should use your hands or brush to brush it evenly on the surface
- Generally, fried meat and fried meat need to be marinated in advance.Fried meat should ensure the tender texture of the meat. Cooking often requires high heat and short time.When cooking in a short time is not easy to taste, marinating in advance can make up for the lack of flavor

## Pickle technique

- Fine shredded pork, thin slices of meat: Because the meat is fragile, it needs to be as gentle as possible.Fingers are in the shape of claw machine pliers, gently grasp the marinade.Then stir gently in one direction
- Shredded meat, sliced ​​meat, and cubes: The technique is the same as above, but the power can be slightly greater
- Chicken legs, chicken wings and other sizes: first change a few flower knives on the ingredients.The roots of chicken wings and chicken legs can be pierced with a knife.Then mix the marinade in the bowl and wrap the ingredients evenly in the bowl
- Lamb leg and other size: generally, pierce holes can be pierced in places with thicker meat.Then mix the marinade and apply it evenly on the surface of the ingredients

## Pickle container and time

- Choose a container that can hold ingredients and marinades.Including bowls, plates, trays, etc.This is the opening pickling time, which is generally short, and a pickling time of 0.5-2 hours is common.(Baked) lamb legs, etc. can also be marinated in this way, but it takes a long time
- Choose a large enough food sealed bag to pickle.At this time, it is sealed and marinated, which is usually very long, such as overnight pickling, or pickling pork ribs that are not easy to taste.Common 4 hours - overnight.At this time, the ingredients should be slightly reduced to prevent the taste of the finished dish from being too heavy and too salty
