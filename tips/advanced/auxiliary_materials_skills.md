# Auxiliary Techniques

* The order of adding auxiliary ingredients is basically the following: first add ginger, then add green onion, garlic, chili, then add dry ingredients (star anise/spicy pepper/pickle), then add dried chili.Each of the above steps can be removed from the queue depending on the cooking.
* Ginger has the largest moisture content, which means we need more time to stir-fry out the ginger juice.
* If you are using scallion slices (it is best to use a kitchen knife to pat the scallion slices twice), then I recommend you put the scallion slices first and then the minced garlic. If you are using scallion slices, you can put these two auxiliary ingredients into the pot together.Note: The juice in the scallion segment is harder to stir-fry out.
* If you are cooking, I would recommend adding dry ingredients before adding ginger, which can make the oil more flavorful and the fried dishes more fragrant.Why do not stew or braised vegetables do this? It is because you may need to stir-fry many auxiliary ingredients, so that the stir-frying time of the auxiliary ingredients will cause the dry ingredients to become black and bitter.
* Put the dried peppers at the end because they can easily turn black due to the temperature of the pan. Stir the dried peppers slightly for a few seconds.
* Note: No matter what dish you like to cook, frying these auxiliary ingredients on low heat until golden brown can make the whole dish more fragrant, which is something that seasonings cannot give.

## Salt release timing and salt quantity control

* Add salt to the quick stir-frying dish first, the amount of salt = total weight of ingredients x0.9%;
* Add salt when the meat dish is 80% mature, the amount of salt = (total weight of ingredients + 30mL juice) x (1~1.2%);
* Add salt at the end of the soup dish, the amount of salt = the initial amount of water x0.8%.
* The total salt volume of a day should not exceed 5g, refer to [WHO](https://www.who.int/zh/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/salt-reduction)
