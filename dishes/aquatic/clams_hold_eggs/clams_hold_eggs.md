## Additional content

* In more cases, local areas in Fuzhou will use horse hoof (relieving greasy) and potato (washing oil). Because they can't buy it during the epidemic, they use pineapple.
* Fujian cuisine is mainly sweet. If you can't get used to it, you can give up sugar.
* You can use a spoon to beat the lean meat piece and hear the sound to determine whether the lean meat is fried thoroughly.
