## Additional content

- Technical summary:
- This dish is just fine with hands. The key point is the heat. The size of the fish will be related to the heat. Too long will cause the fish to be too old and extremely affect the taste. Too short will cause some fish to be not cooked.Therefore, it is generally better to steam fish over high heat within 10 minutes.
- Remember to use chopsticks to separate the plates for the fish. There are two benefits to doing this:
- 1. The fish will drip water onto the plate during steaming. If the fish comes into contact directly, it will cause fish to become fishy when eaten.
- 2. Can heat the fish evenly.
- This dish is simple and tastes great
