# Food Safety

## Poisoning

The following foods are at risk of poisoning:

* Unripe green tomatoes
* Unripe green beans (kidney beans), cowpea (bean beans), [white knife beans](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%99%BD%E5%88%80%E8%B1%86)
* Sprouted potatoes (yam), sweet potatoes (sweet potatoes), peanuts
* Incorrectly handled/unripe [daylily] (https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%BB%84%E8%8A%B1%E8%8F%9C) can cause [colchicine] (https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%8B%E6%B0%B4%E4%BB%99%E7%B4%A0) poisoning
* Raw soy milk
* Fungus that has been soaked for too long (not only fungus, but all fungi have the risk of poisoning when they are soaked for too long)
* Uncooked animal viscera
* Unknown mushrooms or undercooked mushrooms (There is a proverb: red umbrellas, white poles, and lie down on the board after eating. Generally speaking, the more beautiful the mushrooms are, the more dangerous it is.)
* … (Additional supplements are welcome)

Acid foods can also cause poisoning for a long time in aluminum containers, such as

* sauerkraut
* Dried bamboo shoots
* Tomato sauce
* Lemon juice
* Braised meat
* Soy sauce and pickles
* … (Additional supplements are welcome)

## allergy

The following are common allergic foods:

aldult:

* Shrimp, crab, shellfish and seafood
* peanut
* Nuts
* Fish

child:

* peanut
* Nuts
* Eggs
* milk
* Wheat and soybeans

## Salmonella infection

Salmonella is more common in animal-derived foods, including vegetables, and may also contain salmonella due to feces contamination.

The following foods are at risk of Salmonella infection:

* Undercooked eggs
* Incompletely cooked meat
* Unsterilized milk

## Aflatoxin

Aflatoxin is often produced by several other molds such as Aflatoxin and Aspergillus parasitica in moldy grains, such as rice, beans, peanuts, etc., and is by far the strongest carcinogen.It only starts to decompose after heating to above 280℃, so general heating is not easy to destroy its structure.

The following foods are at risk of aflatoxin poisoning:

* Rotten peanuts
* Rotten rice
* Rotten corn

Note that the above foods also include their corresponding products, such as rice flour and cornmeal; peanut seedlings (germinated peanuts) that have been safely cultivated and produced can be considered safe and edible.

## 3-Nitropropionic acid

3-nitropropionic acid is produced by Rhodospora, which is commonly parasitic in sugarcane and coconut.The main manifestation of poisoning is damage to the central nervous system.Symptoms in the acute phase include vomiting, dizziness, paroxysmal convulsions, lateral gaze, coma, and even death. The sequelae are mainly damage to the extrapyramidal system. The main symptoms include flexion, torsion, spasm, limb stiffness, and decreased tension at rest.There is no specific antidote for this toxin.

The following foods are at risk of 3-nitropropionic acid poisoning:

* Red Heart Sugar Cane
* [Roasted Coconut](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1w84y147TU)

In addition to visual appearance as a criterion, smell is also an important criterion for evaluation.Rotten plants often exude special odors (drilled lees, sour taste, etc.).The best way to deal with food that smells rotten is to discard it.

## Parasite

Parasites can enter the human body through air, drinking water, food and direct contact.If the parasite enters the human circulatory system, it can attack white blood cells on the one hand, and on the other hand, it can reach the lungs, liver and other organs or block blood vessels or lymphatic ducts, which will cause diseases such as cirrhosis, portal hypertension, elephant dermatosis and other diseases.If a person is the intermediate host of pork tapeworms, the parasites may even reach the eyeballs, heart and brain, endangering life.

It is best to ensure that the following foods are completely cooked, otherwise corresponding parasites may be left in the body:

* Snail: Pipeline nematode
* Sashimi: liver tickling
* Eel: Jaw-mouth nematode
* Bullfrog: Mannelloparasi
* Pork: Pork Tapeworm
* Beef surface (you can eat as long as the surface is cooked): Beef tapeworm

## Food safety temperature

By heating food at sufficient temperature and maintaining it for a certain period of time, the risk of bacteria and parasites survival can be reduced to a certain extent.
Various types of food have different temperature requirements. Cookers should use a kitchen thermometer to measure the temperature of the food center.

The temperature measurement should be measured using: a kitchen thermometer
Measure the temperature of the food center

The following are industry-standard food safety temperatures:

pork
Whole block: 71°C
Minced meat: 71°C

birds
Whole block: 74°C
Minced meat: 74°C
All: 85°C

Beef * Lamb
Whole piece:
3 minutes: 63°C
5 minutes: 71°C
7 minutes: 77°C
Minced meat: 71°C

Eggs: 74°C

Reheat leftovers: 74°C
