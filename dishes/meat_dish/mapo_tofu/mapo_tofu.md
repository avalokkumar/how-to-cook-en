## operate

- Chop garlic and ginger, set aside
- Cut millet spicy into chili circles, set aside
- Cut pork belly into minced meat (I originally bought minced meat to skip)
- Add half of the salt and Weiji fresh soy sauce to the minced meat, stir well and set aside
- Cut the duck eggs in half with a kitchen knife (be careful to be safe), remove the egg yolks (must remove them, otherwise they will be fishy), and mash the remaining egg whites into about 2 mm * 2 mm in size, do not need to be too broken, set aside
- Unpack the tofu and use a fruit knife to cut the tofu in the box to approximately 2.5 cm * 3 cm in size, spare
- Heat the pan and put 10ml - 15ml cooking oil in the pan.Wait for 10 seconds to let the oil temperature rise
- Make it low heat, add garlic, ginger, chili rings, peppercorns, salted duck eggs, and garlic hot sauce for 20 seconds to stir-fry to bring the aroma
- Make the meat to medium heat, add the minced meat, stir-fry for about 1 minute, and the meat will change color
- Make low heat, add tofu, and sprinkle the remaining salt and Weiji fresh soy sauce on the tofu evenly
- Pour boiling water from the edge of the pot (or the tofu will break easily), and just leave the tofu
- Turn on the high heat, turn to medium heat immediately after the water boils, and wait for about 10 minutes
- Wait until only 1/5 of the water is left and the surface of the tofu has been colored, turn off the heat and serve on the plate
